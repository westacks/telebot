/**
 * Represents a general file to be sent.
 * @property-read string $type Type of the result, must be document
 * @property-read InputFile|string $media File to send. Pass a file_id to send a file that exists on the Telegram servers (recommended), pass an HTTP URL for Telegram to get a file from the Internet, or pass “attach://<file_attach_name>” to upload a new one using multipart/form-data under <file_attach_name> name. More information on Sending Files »
 * @property-read ?string $thumbnail Optional. Thumbnail of the file sent; can be ignored if thumbnail generation for the file is supported server-side. The thumbnail should be in JPEG format and less than 200 kB in size. A thumbnail's width and height should not exceed 320. Ignored if the file is not uploaded using multipart/form-data. Thumbnails can't be reused and can be only uploaded as a new file, so you can pass “attach://<file_attach_name>” if the thumbnail was uploaded using multipart/form-data under <file_attach_name>.
